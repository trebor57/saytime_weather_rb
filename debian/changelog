saytime-weather-rb (0.0.2-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fix multi-word weather condition handling in weather.rb
    - Fixed issue where conditions like "Mostly Sunny" only announced the first word
    - Now properly collects and concatenates all matching word sound files
    - Preserves original word order for correct pronunciation
  * Add TZ environment variable support for timezone override
    - Users can now override timezone by setting TZ environment variable
    - TZ takes precedence over weather.rb timezone and system local time
    - Useful for UTC time announcements or custom timezone requirements
    - Example: TZ=UTC saytime.rb -l 75001 -n 123456
